# Water Quality Prediction
This project is done as a part of Edunet-AICTE internship, sponsored by Shell. 

## Project Overview

This project aims at accurate prediction of Water Quality Metrics and helps in early detection of pollution. MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor is used for implementation.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- Pandas, NumPy – Data handling and preprocessing
- Scikit-learn – Model training and evaluation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualisation
- Jupyter Notebook – Interactive experimentation
- VS Code and Streamlit – Application interface and deployment

## Dataset

- **Source**: Water quality dataset from the Southern Bug River, Ukraine
- **Target Metrics**:
- NH₄ (Ammonium)
- BSK5 (Biochemical Oxygen Demand)
- Suspended Solids
- O₂ (Dissolved Oxygen)
- NO₃, NO₂, SO₄, PO₄, Cl⁻ (Chemical Indicators)

## Internship Details

- Internship Type: AICTE Virtual Internship - Edunet Foundation
- Sponsor: Shell
- Duration: June 2025 (1 month)
- Focus Area: Machine Learning in Environmental Monitoring
